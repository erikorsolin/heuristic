### This heuristic proposes to develop a solution to the three-dimensional packing problem. 
This problem is found in several applications in the real world, presenting considerable scales and temporal
criticality for the solution. For example, we find it in the maritime transport sector in at least
two different applications: in the packaging of pallets inside containers and in the distribution of
these containers on cargo ships. Furthermore, it is computationally difficult, thus formulating
an interesting problem in the context of computer science.
